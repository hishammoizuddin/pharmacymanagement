**FirstCare Pharmacy**

This Pharmacy Management System will be able to provide quick service to medical patients, with the help of previously saved records. However, new records can be added and old ones modified whenever a new patient or a previous patient visits the pharmacy. To identify the patient, each patient will be provided with a Patient Number and during the data entry process, all their required information will be added into the file in the binary format. With the help of the Patient Number, the system will be easily able to retrieve their patientâ€™s data and prepare for the bills. 
Only the Admin will have the access to the entry, modification and retrieval of the data.
